# JavaScript and Css(FreeCodeCamp)
Learning javascript and css from a youtube video of FreeCodeCamp.  
[Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys&t=4442s) 

## Day 1
Learned about differences between `let`, `var`, `const` 

## Day 2
Learned about different datatypes  like `string` `arrays` `objects` etc


## Day 3
Learned about operators like other programming language. 

Only difference is that it has an implicit comparator `===`

Another new thing that is learned is that JS has immediately invoked function

**Example of the normal function**
```
//this is normal funciton 
const result = () => {
	return 50;
}
// it doestnot give output instantly
```    

**Example of the immediately invoked function**   
```
// this is the new one 
const result = (() => {
	return 50;
})();
// it gives output without instantly
```
